# DISCLAIMER

**WARNING: DO NOT USE ON REAL ROBOTS WITHOUT EXPERT REVIEW**

This is a research and educational simulation project for swarm robotics. It is NOT intended for real-world deployment without:

1. **Expert Safety Review**: All algorithms must be reviewed by robotics safety experts
2. **Hardware Testing**: Extensive testing on real hardware in controlled environments
3. **Safety Systems**: Implementation of emergency stop mechanisms, collision avoidance, and fail-safe systems
4. **Certification**: Proper certification for autonomous systems in your jurisdiction

## Known Limitations

- No real-time guarantees
- Simplified physics models
- No hardware fault tolerance
- Limited collision detection
- No emergency stop mechanisms
- No sensor noise modeling
- No communication delays/failures

## Safety Requirements for Real Deployment

- Implement emergency stop buttons
- Add velocity and acceleration limits
- Include collision detection sensors
- Implement fail-safe behaviors
- Add watchdog timers
- Include manual override capabilities
- Test extensively in controlled environments

**Use at your own risk. The authors assume no responsibility for any damage or injury.**
